# Interactive Rating Component

This project is an **Interactive Rating Component** created as part of a coding challenge on Front End Mentor. The component allows users to select a rating from 1 to 5, submit their rating, and view a customized "Thank you" screen that displays their chosen rating.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to build a user-friendly rating experience. Users are encouraged to give feedback on their experience, which will help us enhance the service based on user ratings. The component contains:

- A section where users can select their rating by clicking on one of the rating buttons.
- A "Submit" button that, when clicked, displays a thank-you message with the user's selected rating.

The project includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to handle both the UI design and interactivity.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works well on all device sizes, adjusting layout for mobile and desktop.
- **Interactive Rating Selection**: Users can click on a number (1-5) to select their rating, which visually highlights the selected rating.
- **Custom Thank-You Message**: After submission, users see a message confirming their selected rating.
